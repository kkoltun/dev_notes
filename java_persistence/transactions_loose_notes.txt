Session vs transaction:
* Session may be spanning over multiple transactions.
* Over the same connection multiple (begin transaction - commit) are possible.

Transaction classes:
* JDBC Transaction - transaction managed through a JDBC Connection.
* CMT Transaction - all work done in the context of a container managed transaction. CMT is not neccessarily container-managed, the point is that the transactions are managed by something other than Hibernate.

XA transaction = global transaction:
* May span multiple resources.
* Talking to multiple resources in a single transaction.
* Websphere, Weblogic or JBoss acting as a TransactionManager.
* Various resources - Oracle Sybase, IBM MQ, JMS, SAP acting as *transaction resources*.
* *Commit* - results are commited across all of the resources.
* *Rollback* - everything is rolled back across all resources.
* Two phase commit protocol is used.
