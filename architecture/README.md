# Design Patterns

## Why patterns are important

1. They help to create flexible designs that are maintainable and can cope with change.
2. They provide vocabulary to communicate with other developers.
3. They enable to stay at the "design level" a bit longer, analyze the abstraction before getting down to implementation.
4. Widen the variety of solutions to problems in mind.
5. They are more than only OO design principles - they are (sometimes non-obvious) ways of constructing object-oriented systems, that otherwise would be achieved by hard, iterative work.
