# Optimistic Concurrency Control

**Handling concurrency in an optimistic way is appropriate when:**
* **Concurrent modifications are rare.**
* **It is feasible to detects conflicts late in a unit of work.**

In a JPA application, versioning has to be enabled to enable *first commit wins* mechanism.

`#todo` Tests to be implemented:
* Excluding properties from versioning.
* `OptimisticLockType.Dirty`.
* `Query#setLockMode()`.
* Forcing a version increment.

## Entity versioning

### Enabling versioning

**The usual way to enable versioning:** the `@Version` annotation. In this case:
* If an `int`, `Integer`, `short` etc. field is annotated, a simple counter is created. Hibernate wraps and starts from zero again if the version number reaches the limit of the data type.
* If a date field is annotated, a timestamp is created. It is slightly less safe, because two transactions could both load and update the same `Item` in the same millisecond. Furthermore, retrieving the current time from JVM isn't necessary safe in a clustered environment.

**Alternative to version numbers and timestamps:** annotation `@OptimisticLocking(type = OptimisticLockType.ALL)` used with `@DynamicUpdate` on a whole entity class. In this case:
1. Hibernate will execute a dynamically created `UPDATE` with `WHERE` clause explicitly set last known entity property values to flush a modifications.
2. If any concurrent transaction has modified any of these values or even deleted the row, the statement returns zero updated rows. In this case Hibernate will throw an exception at flush time.
3. To make Hibernate look only for modification conflicts use `OptimisticLockType.DIRTY`.

### Versioning features

**What modifications trigger the increment of the entity's version:**
* The version is incremented whenever an entity instance is dirty. This includes any single-valued (`String`, `int`) properties and embedded ones (`Address`).
* This does not include `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToMany` association collections that have been made read-only with `mappedBy`. Any changes done to these collections will not increment the version of the owning entity instance.
* Changes made to properties annotated with `OptimisticLock(excluded = true)` will not increase entity version.

**Making particular reads repeatable:**
* Use JPA `Query` interface with method `Query#setLockMode()`.
* This will make Hibernate check each loaded item at flush time. If the version of any item has already changed or row no longer exists, an `OptimisticLockException` is thrown.

**Forcing a version increment:**
* Sometimes even loading should increment the entity version. In this case use `LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT` in `EntityManager#find()` method arguments.
* This is useful when the client inserts or modifies data and wants the version of some root instance of an aggregate to be incremented (eg. while inserting a new maximal `Bid`, force an increment of the root `Item` entity version.
* Note that if the exemplary `Bid#item` entity association would be changed from `@ManyToOne` to `@ElementCollection` of `Item#bids`, adding a `Bid` to the collection would increment the `Item` version. It is a matter of parent/child ambiguity.
