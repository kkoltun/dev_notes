# Design patterns principles form Heads First Book

#### Identify aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

This means taking what varies and "encapsulating" it so it won't affect the rest of the code.

Patterns:
* strategy.

#### Program to an interface, not an implementation.

#### Favor composition over inheritance.

This means a lot more flexibility and dynamic change of objects at runtime.

Patterns:
* strategy.

#### Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

This means obtaining flexible OO systems, that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.

Patterns:
* observer.

#### Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

This means allowing classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behavior without modifying existing code.
This usually leads to new levels of abstraction.

Patterns:
* observer;
* decorator.
