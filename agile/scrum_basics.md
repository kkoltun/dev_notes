# SCRUM basics

## What is SCRUM:

* it is a framework, not a methodology;
* it is empirical;
* it is all about transparency, adaptation and inspection;
* it is iterative;
* it is about delivering in small increments.

## Values in SCRUM

**Courage**:
* to speak up;
* to do the right thing;
* to talk open and honestly within the team.

**Focus**:
* on the things that the team is going to work on;
* on the team.

**Commitment**:
* to the team;
* to the work.

**Respect** to other people.

**Openness** to other people, their and your problems.

## Facts

Some facts about SCRUM:
* you must deliver at least once per sprint, not necessarily for production but for client;
* it is about planning and forecasting, not committing;
* **you are always sprinting, the minute you stop the last sprint, you begin another**;
* 

## Roles

### Scrum Master

* support and coach the team;
* make sure the team is abiding by the rules of SCRUM;
* coach the SCRUM team;
* facilitate the work;
* make sure the team is working together and tackling problems together;
* make a shield above the team to help them focus;
* shield off people from outside wanting to add more tasks etc.

A good SCRUM master teaches the team to be self-reliant, independent and to scale out.
This makes it possible to be a SCRUM master in more than one team simultaneously.

### Product Owner

* focused on delivering values to stakeholders;
* brings requirements from stakeholders and build the Product Backlog that drives value;
* does just-in-time to make sure that the team is delivering frequently;
* removes what is redundant;
* must have power to make decisions, but in their decisions relies on developers, analysts;
* is held responsible for the products and the right direction;
* prioritizes the work.

### Development Team

* self-organizing to deliver the value in time;
* is doing forecasts not commitments;
* transforms Product Backlog Items into increments;
* is responsible for delivering the value defined by Product Owner;
* works in a culture of learning and collaboration.

## Artifacts

### Product Backlog

* items to be worked on;
* consists of open work to be done;
* owned by the Product Owner;
* open for changes, additions and refining;
* constantly inspected and adapted based on the vision of what to deliver;
* ordered, estimated, refined, public and available;
* **defines the value that the team is going to deliver**.

### Sprint Backlog

* all Product Backlog Items selected for a Sprint team and is planned to be delivered within it;
* owned by the Development Team;
* items may be refined.

### Increment

* what we are ready to deliver;
* there must be at least one increment per sprint, there may be many;
* **working software**;
* **done = releasable**;
* stakeholders give real feedback basing on it.

## Events

### Spring planning

* kickoff of the new spring, it is a part of it;
* looking what is in the backlog;
* Product Owner creates the goal for the sprint;
* Development Team pulls items from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog;
* sizing items, sometimes dividing them;
* making sure the items are well understood between Product Owner and Development Team;
* **you do not need to build a full sprint backlog to start a sprint, you need just enough items in it**;

## Miscellanea

### Fractured perspective

* Usually after implementing SCRUM in a team;
* [Blind men an an elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant) - *So while the agile 'elephant' is made up of many great practices, this whole thing is even greater than the sum of the parts*;
* *The developers think about developer stuff, project managers think about project manager stuff, and they throw the code over the wall to a business user who thinks about business stuff."*
* The team members are functioning as individuals working separately toward compatible goals, not as a team.
