# Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The web browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server.

Main purposes of cookies:
1. **Session management** - logins, shopping carts, game scores, anything the server should remember.
2. **Personalization** - user preferences, themes.
3. **Tracking** - recording and analyzing user behavior.

In past, cookies were used for general client-side storage - they were the only way to store data on the client. Nowadays modern storage APIs are preferred - `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` and indexedDB.

`Set-Cookie` header is used to create a cookie.

## Cookie directives

### Session and permanent cookies

**Session cookies** are cookies without specified expiration (default). Theses are supposed to be deleted when client shuts down.
However, web browsers may use **session restoring** which makes most session cookies permanent.

**Permanent cookies** are cookies with specified expiration - `Expires` or `Max-Age`.
The date set in `Expires` is relative to the client the cookie is being set on, not the server.

### `Secure` and `HttpOnly` cookies

**Secure cookie** is only sent to the server with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol.

**HttpOnly** cookie is inaccessible to JavaScript's `Document.cookie` API, they are only sent to the server.
This applies to, for example, cookies that persist server-side sessions.

```
Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT; Secure; HttpOnly
```

### Setting the scope of a cookie

The scope of the cookie signals what URLs the cookies should be sent to.

`Domain` directive:
* specifies allowed hosts to receive the cookie;
* it defaults to the host of the current document location, excluding subdomains (for `mozilla.org` the cookies will not be included on `developer.mozilla.org`);
* if specified, then the subdomain are always included (if `Domain=mozilla.org` is set, the cookies will be included on `developer.mozilla.org`).

`Path` directive:
* specifies a URL path that must exist in the requested URL in order to send the `Cookie` header;
* uses %x2F ("/") character as a directory separator;
* matches subdirectories (if `Path=/docs` is set, `/docs`, `/docs/Web/` etc. will match).

### `SameSite` cookies

`SameSite` directive:
* means that a cookie shouldn't be sent with cross-site requests;
* this somewhat protects against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF);
* is not yet supported by all browsers.

Directive strictness:
* `SameSite=strict` - the cookies will be sent only if the request originated from the website that set the cookie;
* `SameSite=lax` - the cookies will not be sent on cross-domain subrequests - calls to load images or frames; the cookies will be sent when a user navigates to the URL from an external site, for example, by following a link.
